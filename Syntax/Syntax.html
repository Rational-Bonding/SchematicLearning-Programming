    <p class="description">On most programming reference websites you'll notice a confusing language explaining the use of a programming function. This is known as syntax. What you hardly ever see is a page like this one that explains how to read their site's syntax. The use of symbols to represent syntax when you are in the process of learning which symbols to type for your code can be confusing. For this reason, here we use font exclusively to describe the syntactic meaning of code uses and we offer this cheatsheet to turn to when you aren't sure. </p>
     <p class="description">You'll also notice that every part of our code schematics can be hovered over to get further insight into the meaning and limitations of every detail.</p>
