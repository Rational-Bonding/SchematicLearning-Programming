# SchematicLearning-Programming
A tutoring and reference site that uses simplified responsive schematics to teach code.

The following are pens I've made for this site. currently I am unsure as to how to fully transfer them to this repository. You can see my first attempt to transfer the programming page is a mess right now.

## About Philosophist
I am new to git and github, at least in terms of using them to work on a project. My idea for this project is to teach the way that I would teach, anything. I'm a physics/biology undergrad who turned to code after dropping out for financial reasons. I have also gained experience as a science and math tutor over the years. I have a beef with the wya textbooks are written. Particulary where the easiest concepts that could be conveyed in a formula or an image are taught through long senseless essays of text. Even people who learn and just need a referece have to struggle to search for a tiny but significant detail in their old texts. This is ineffective. My teaching philosophy is to first show the concept in it's simplest and most straightforward form, like a map or a schematic. Everything that is in that schematic should be what the concept feels like in the memory of a professional, in the form of variables and pictures and if/then reflexes. 

That said, I need help. At least one mentor/partner to get it up and running. I want the final product to be a free resource for students to access with a search to quickly understand or remember what they are trying to learn. It should be a wiki-like structure, but where pieces of content are available and able to be voted up and down for the main page. Someone who isn't understanding from what is on the main page of a topic should be able to see other versions that were contributed and find what works for them. Before I get to that point I want to prove the concept by just making the first set of pages with the help of volunteer contributers in the github community. For me, and a lot of them, I expect this will be a great little proving ground to make it clear to employers that we are more than hireable. I want to both teach and to be taught through this experience.
